# 3128-common
Common "repo" for Team 3128. 

## This is a Git submodule for Team 3128 code repositories. 

It holds common code - motors, limelights, interpolation, etc - which can be used in any other Team 3128 repository. 

This allows us to **reuse the same common code in multiple robot repos from year to year with preserved commit history**. 
It allows us to easily change a common file for all repos through changing it in here, then pulling to update the submodule in all repos using the common repo submodule.
